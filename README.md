##    **SymPhi Ledger physics-backed symbolic implication kernel for modular, self-improving AI.**
**SymPhi Ledger is a next-generation symbolic reasoning kernel** that treats logical implication as a physical process governed by conserved quantities and symmetry principles. By embedding computation into an energy-conserving algebraic framework inspired by Noether’s theorem and gauge theories, SymPhi Ledger enables: Exact conservation of semantic “energy” across inference chains.

Native detection of symmetry-breaking attacks and logical paradoxes
Modular, composable reasoning primitives that self-improve through gradient-free structure search
Provable bounds on inference complexity and cryptographic hardness

**Core features:** 
Alphabet symmetry classification & canonicalization
Exact energy-based proof scoring and implication validation
Hypergraph-based Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) topology
Vectorized symbolic execution engine (zero numerical approximation)
Built-in applications: unbreakable cryptographic protocols, robust autonomous reasoning, paradox-resistant goal refinement

**Key modules:** 
__symphi_framework.py, symphi_core_engine.py__

If you’re building AI that needs mathematically guaranteed correctness, resistance to adversarial prompts, or the ability to reason about its own reasoning, SymPhi gives you the physics-inspired foundation other symbolic systems lack.
